      If you would like to bring your own domain you also get a pre-configured
      DNS server. DNS will provide you with end-points such as domain.org,
      api.domain.org, app.domain.org. <br />
      In that case enter the name for the domain in:

      Access to your network is secured and compatible and supports wireguard
      encryption, so you can also connect many supported routers. But you get a
      very cool router attached to your new IP, so: no sweat.

      Think a web server, of course, but also an ethereum node, or just a bunch
      of people who work remotely and want to share the same LAN across the
      universe without intruding their existing network setup.
